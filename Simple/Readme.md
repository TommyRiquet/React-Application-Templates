# Simple React Application

This repository contains a simple React application that showcases a basic file structure for building React projects. It provides a starting point for developing React applications with a simple folder structure.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following main folders:

- `public`: This folder serves as the root directory for static assets that are directly accessible by the application. It contains the main HTML file (`index.html`) and other static files like icons, images, or fonts.

- `src`: This folder contains the source code for the React application. It includes components, hooks, tests, and other necessary files.

    - `__test__`: This folder holds the unit tests or test-related files for the React components.

    - `components`: This folder contains the React components that are responsible for rendering different parts of the application's user interface (UI).

    - `hooks`: This folder stores custom hooks, which are reusable functions that encapsulate logic for managing state or side effects in functional components.

## Usage

To set up and run the simple React application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory using a command line interface.

3. Install the necessary dependencies by running the command:

npm install


4. Start the development server by running the command:

npm start

This will launch the application in your default browser, and any changes you make to the source code will be automatically reloaded.
