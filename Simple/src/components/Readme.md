## Components Folder

The `components` folder is where you will create and store your React components. This folder follows a component-based approach, where each component resides in its own file and is responsible for rendering a specific part of your application's user interface (UI). You can further organize this folder into subfolders based on the logical grouping of your components.

## Usage

The `components` folder contains the React components of your application. Each component should have its own file with a descriptive name. It is advisable to create reusable and modular components to promote code reusability and maintainability. You can include information about the purpose and usage of specific components in the README.md file within this folder.
