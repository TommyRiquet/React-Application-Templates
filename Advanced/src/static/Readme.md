# Static Folder in an Advanced React Application

The `static` folder is a directory within the `src` folder of your advanced React application. It is used to store static files that don't require any processing by the build system. This README.md explains the purpose and usage of the `static` folder.

## Introduction

The `static` folder provides a place to store static files that are not processed by the build system but are relevant to your application. These files can include documentation, media assets, or other resources.

## Folder Structure

In an advanced React application, the `static` folder might look like this:

src/
static/
README.md
...

vbnet


## Usage

Here are some best practices for using the `static` folder effectively:

- Place files in the `static` folder that don't require any processing by the build system, such as documentation, media files, or other resources.
- Reference the files using their relative paths from your components or pages.

By utilizing the `static` folder, you can easily include and access static files in your advanced React application.
