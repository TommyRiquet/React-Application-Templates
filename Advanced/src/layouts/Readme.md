# Layouts Folder in an Advanced React Application

The `layouts` folder is a directory within the `src` folder of your advanced React application. It contains layout components that define the overall structure and composition of different pages or sections of your application. This README.md explains the purpose and usage of the `layouts` folder.

## Introduction

In an advanced React application, layouts are used to define the structure and composition of different pages or sections. Layout components act as containers that hold other components and define how they are arranged within a specific context.

## Folder Structure

In an advanced React application, the `layouts` folder might look like this:

src/
layouts/
MainLayout.js
...

sql


## Usage

To create a new layout component, create a separate file within the `layouts` folder. Here are some best practices for using the `layouts` folder effectively:

- Name the layout file with a descriptive and meaningful name that reflects its purpose or content.
- Define the layout and structure of the page or section within the layout component. This component can hold other components, such as headers, footers, navigation bars, or sidebars, and define their placement and styling.

By utilizing the `layouts` folder, you can create reusable layout components that define the structure and composition of various parts of your advanced React application.
