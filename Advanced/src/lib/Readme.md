# Lib Folder in an Advanced React Application

The `lib` folder is a directory within the `src` folder of your advanced React application. It can be used to store utility files, helper functions, or API clients that are shared across your application. This README.md explains the purpose and usage of the `lib` folder.

## Introduction

The `lib` folder is a common location for storing utility files, helper functions, or API clients that are used throughout your advanced React application. It provides a central place to keep reusable code that doesn't belong to a specific component or feature.

## Folder Structure

In an advanced React application, the `lib` folder might look like this:

src/
lib/
api.js
utils.js
...

## Usage

Here are some examples of what you can store in the `lib` folder:

- Utility functions that perform common tasks and can be used across different components or features.
- API clients or modules responsible for making HTTP requests and interacting with external services or APIs.
- Constants or configuration files that are used throughout your application.

By utilizing the `lib` folder effectively, you can centralize shared code and improve code reusability and maintainability in your advanced React application.
