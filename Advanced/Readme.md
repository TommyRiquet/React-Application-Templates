# Advanced React Application

This repository contains an advanced React application that showcases a structured file organization for building large-scale React projects. It provides a foundation for developing React applications with a more complex and modular architecture.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following main folders:

- `public`: This folder serves as the root directory for static assets that are directly accessible by the application. It contains the main HTML file (`index.html`) and other static files like icons, images, or fonts.

- `src`: This folder contains the source code for the React application. It includes assets, components, features, layouts, lib, contexts, hooks, pages, services, and static files.

    - `assets`: This folder is used to store static assets such as images, icons, or fonts that are used in your application.

    - `components`: This folder contains the React components that are responsible for rendering different parts of the application's user interface (UI).

    - `features`: This folder is used to store feature-specific code and related files.

    - `layouts`: This folder contains layout components that define the overall structure and composition of different pages or sections of your application.

    - `lib`: This folder can be used to store utility files, helper functions, or API clients that are shared across your application.

    - `contexts`: This folder is used to store context providers and consumers, allowing you to manage global state or share data across components without prop drilling.

    - `hooks`: This folder is used to store custom hooks, which are reusable functions that encapsulate logic for managing state or side effects in functional components.

    - `pages`: This folder contains the React components that represent individual pages or views of your application.

    - `services`: This folder can be used to store service files or API clients that encapsulate the logic for interacting with external services or APIs.

    - `static`: This folder is used to store static files that don't require any processing by the build system.

## Usage

To set up and run the advanced React application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory using a command line interface.

3. Install the necessary dependencies by running the command:

npm install


4. Start the development server by running the command:

npm start


This will launch the application in your default browser, and any changes you make to the source code will be automatically reloaded.
