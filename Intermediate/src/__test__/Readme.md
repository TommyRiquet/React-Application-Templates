## __test__ Folder

The `__test__` folder, also known as the test folder, is a conventional location to store your unit tests or test-related files. It is not a mandatory folder in the `src` structure, but it helps to maintain a separate location for tests and ensures better organization of your testing code.

## Usage

The `__test__` folder is commonly used to store test files for your React application. You can write unit tests, integration tests, or any other type of tests in this folder. Make sure to follow a consistent naming convention for your test files, such as appending `.test.js` or `.spec.js` to the file names.
