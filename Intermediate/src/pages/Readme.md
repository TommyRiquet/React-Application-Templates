# Pages Folder in an Intermediate React Application

The `pages` folder is a directory within the `src` folder of your intermediate React application. It contains React components that represent individual pages or views of your application. This README.md explains the purpose and usage of the `pages` folder.

## Introduction

In an intermediate React application, each page typically corresponds to a specific route or URL and is composed of various UI components. The `pages` folder provides a dedicated location to store these components, allowing you to organize and manage your application's views effectively.

## Folder Structure

In an intermediate React application, the `pages` folder might look like this:

src/
pages/
Home.js
...

## Usage

To create a new page component, create a separate file for each page within the `pages` folder. Here are some best practices for using the `pages` folder effectively:

- Name the page file with a descriptive and meaningful name that reflects the purpose or content of the page.
- Define the layout and structure of the page within the page component. This component can make use of other components, hooks, or contexts defined in other folders.
- Create separate page components for different routes or views in your application.

By organizing your page components in the `pages` folder, you can easily manage and navigate between different views in your intermediate React application.
