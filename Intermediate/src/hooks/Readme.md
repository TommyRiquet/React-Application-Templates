# Hooks Folder in an Intermediate React Application

The `hooks` folder is a directory within the `src` folder of your intermediate React application. It is used to store custom hooks, which are reusable functions that encapsulate logic for managing state or side effects in functional components. This README.md explains the purpose and usage of the `hooks` folder.

## Introduction

Custom hooks are a powerful feature in React that allows you to extract and share stateful logic across multiple components. The `hooks` folder provides a dedicated place to store your custom hooks, promoting code reuse and maintaining a clean separation of concerns.

## Folder Structure

In an intermediate React application, the `hooks` folder might look like this:

src/
hooks/
useCounter.js
...

## Usage

To create a custom hook, define a function that uses built-in React hooks like `useState` or `useEffect`. Here are some best practices for using the `hooks` folder effectively:

- Create a separate file for each custom hook within the `hooks` folder.
- Name the hook file with a descriptive and meaningful name that reflects its purpose or functionality.
- Export the custom hook function from the hook file to make it reusable in other components.

By organizing your custom hooks in the `hooks` folder, you can easily manage and share reusable logic across your intermediate React application.
