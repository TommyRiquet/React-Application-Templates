# src Folder in an Intermediate React Application

The `src` folder is the main directory where you write your React components, application logic, and other related files in an intermediate React application. This README.md provides an overview of the `src` folder's structure and its usage.

## Introduction

The `src` folder plays a significant role in an intermediate React application. It holds all the source code files and assets necessary to build and run your application. This folder provides a structured approach to develop your React components, application logic, and pages.

## Folder Structure

An intermediate `src` folder structure in a React application might look like this:

src/
assets/
logo.png
components/
Header.js
Footer.js
contexts/
ThemeContext.js
hooks/
useCounter.js
pages/
Home.js
index.js
App.js

## Usage

The `src` folder acts as the entry point for your application's codebase. It contains various files and subfolders that contribute to the development of your React application. You will typically spend most of your time working within this folder.

## Assets Folder

The `assets` folder is used to store static assets such as images, icons, or fonts that are used in your application. Placing these assets in the `assets` folder helps in organizing and referencing them in your components and pages.

## Components Folder

The `components` folder contains the React components that are responsible for rendering different parts of your application's user interface (UI). Organize your components into subfolders based on the logical grouping of related components.

## Contexts Folder

The `contexts` folder is used to store context providers and consumers that allow sharing data across components without the need for prop drilling. It is a common pattern for managing global state or sharing data between multiple components.

## Hooks Folder

The `hooks` folder is used to store custom hooks that encapsulate reusable logic for managing state or side effects in functional components. Custom hooks promote code reuse and separation of concerns. They can be shared across multiple components or even projects.

## Pages Folder

The `pages` folder contains the React components that represent individual pages or views of your application. These components typically define the layout and structure of a specific page, and they can make use of the components, hooks, and contexts defined in other folders.

By understanding the purpose and proper usage of the `src` folder and its subfolders, you can develop a well-organized and maintainable intermediate React application.
