# Contexts Folder in an Intermediate React Application

The `contexts` folder is a directory within the `src` folder of your intermediate React application. It is used to store context providers and consumers, allowing you to manage global state or share data across components without the need for prop drilling. This README.md explains the purpose and usage of the `contexts` folder.

## Introduction

Contexts play a significant role in managing shared state or data in an intermediate React application. By using contexts, you can avoid prop drilling (passing props through multiple components) and make data accessible to multiple components at different levels of the component tree.

## Folder Structure

In an intermediate React application, the `contexts` folder might look like this:

src/
contexts/
ThemeContext.js
...

## Usage

To create a new context, you can define a context provider and consumer using the `createContext` function from React. Here are some best practices for using the `contexts` folder effectively:

- Create a separate file for each context within the `contexts` folder.
- Name the context file with a descriptive and meaningful name that reflects its purpose.
- Define the context provider component in the context file. This component wraps its children and provides the necessary data or state to consuming components.
- Export the context and its provider component from the context file to make them accessible to other components.

By utilizing the `contexts` folder effectively, you can manage shared state or data seamlessly across your intermediate React application without the need for prop drilling.
