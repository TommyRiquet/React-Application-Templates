# Assets Folder in an Intermediate React Application

The `assets` folder is a directory within the `src` folder of your intermediate React application. It is used to store static assets such as images, icons, or fonts that are used in your application. This README.md explains the purpose and usage of the `assets` folder.

## Introduction

The `assets` folder plays a crucial role in an intermediate React application as it serves as a centralized location to store and manage static assets. These assets can include images, icons, fonts, or any other files required by your application.

## Folder Structure

In an intermediate React application, the `assets` folder might look like this:

src/
assets/
logo.png
icons/
icon1.svg
icon2.svg
fonts/
font1.ttf
font2.ttf

## Usage

The `assets` folder provides a convenient way to organize and reference static assets within your application. Here are some best practices for using the `assets` folder effectively:

- Place all your static assets such as images, icons, and fonts in the `assets` folder.
- Create subfolders within the `assets` folder to further organize your assets based on their type or purpose (e.g., `icons`, `fonts`).
- Reference your assets using relative paths from your components or pages. For example, `<img src="../assets/logo.png" alt="Logo" />`.

By following these practices, you can easily manage your static assets and improve the maintainability of your intermediate React application.
