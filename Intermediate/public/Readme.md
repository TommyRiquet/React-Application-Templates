## Introduction

The `public` folder is a crucial part of a React application's file structure. It acts as a staging area for static assets that are required by your application. These assets can include HTML files, images, and other files that need to be directly accessible.

## Folder Structure

An intermediate React application's folder structure might look like this:

my-react-app/
README.md
package.json
public/
index.html
favicon.ico
...
src/
...

vbnet


The `public` folder contains the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for your React application.
- `favicon.ico`: The icon file displayed in the browser's tab or bookmark bar.

You can place other static assets in the `public` folder that your application requires.

By understanding the purpose and usage of the `public` folder, you can effectively manage your static assets in an intermediate React application.
